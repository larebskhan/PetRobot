# PetRobot
Pet Robot programmed using Arduino that drives and reacts to what is around it
## Components
1. Arduino Uno: Used to program functionlity of the robot
3. Breadboard: Used to develop hadware components
4. Ultrasonic Sensor: Used to determine if something is infront of the robot
5. 2 Motors: Used to move the robot. Forward and backward movement controlled via H-Bridge.
6. Photosensor: Used to determine if something is behind the robot. Comparator circuit used to determine how close behind something is. Potentiometer used for the resistor components to allow for changes in sensitivity to be adjusted.
7. Leds and Buzzers: Used to signal "stuck" positions
